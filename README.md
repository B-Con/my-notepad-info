My Notepad Info
===
My Notepad Info is a simple web-based notepad. It's a personal side project, started years ago when I needed a simple, fast online notepad. It consists of an AJAX JS client that talks to a PHP/MySQL-powered RESTful API.

Goals
---
The goal is for the entire project to act like a simple, authenticated wrapper around a textbox. It should be flexible enough to be used by arbitrary users.

Since I originally wrote this primarily for my own use, that last requirement was in part to keep myself from writing sloppy, ad-hoc code. As a bonus it produced something I could offer to the public. I've continued to keep it public-friendly.

The biggest implicit goal of the project is to stay simple, and I have a couple side "goals" to that end. One is to stay under about 2000 lines of custom code. This is somewhat arbitrary, and in general I do not enjoy arbitrary restrictions like this, but I wanted some metric to ensure the project didn't get too complicated or fancy.

Known "Limitations"
---
* _No mobile integration_ - The era of mobile devices and cloud services make this type of browser-based service out-of-date for many. That's OK, I still occationally need it, and I don't necessarily need to integrate it with anything mobile or cloud-oriented.

* _The theme kind of sucks_ - I know that. But I like to experiment with making themes from scratch and I'm not very gifted in aesthetics, so I try out themes on my personal projects. Since the goal is not to attract a wide user-base and I'm the targeted audience, I don't mind using this to experiment.

* _No CMS_ - The site content is stored as nearly flat text files. But that's OK, I want the project to be just about a couple .JS and .PHP files. It's all about wrapping a textbox.
