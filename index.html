        <h1>My Notepad Info</h1>

<p>My Notepad Info is a simple web-based notepad. It's a personal side project, started years ago when I needed a simple, fast online notepad. It consists of an AJAX JS client that talks to a PHP/MySQL-powered RESTful API.</p>

<p>The goal is to provide a simple, authenticated wrapper around a textbox. That's all. You should be able to easily login, access and edit notes, save them, and leave.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>Smartphones and cloud-y services are probably convenient solutions for more of life. But unfortunately, life still throws situations at us that our normal tools don't quite handle gracefully.</p>

<ul>
<li>We still want to save URLs from a computer that isn't ours. </li>
<li>We still want to write notes that wouldn't be convenient to write down later. </li>
<li>We still need to stash away a blob of text to retrieve later.</li>
</ul><p>Traditionally what do we do when we encounter bizarre workflows? We e-mail ourself. We use our email accounts as freaking temporary notepads. It's horrible. We go to another website, possibly log out of someone else's account, log into our own account, open a page stick something in the e-mail body, then send it to ourselves. Then we later go get it and delete it. Web-based e-mail clients aren't particularly fast, either, so we have moderately long page load times several times over. (And doing it over a slow Internet connection feels like a pain because it takes 2 minutes to do something that should take 20 seconds. It's manageable, but it feels like an eternity.)</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>

<p>Accessing a small notepad should be easy, fast, and painless. Login on the homepage, we show you your notes, you edit them, you save them, you leave. We even try to auto-save them as you go. Slow computer, slow Internet connection, doesn't matter, it loads fast. If you use the keyboard shortcuts you can get in, leave a note, and get out in 8 seconds.</p>

<p>The notepad form has minimal bulk, straight-forward design, and a couple of supporting features. It's all about getting a password-protected text box in front of you with your notes as hassle-free as possible.</p>
