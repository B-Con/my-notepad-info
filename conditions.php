<h1>Your Privacy</h1>

<p>
The administrative staff of My Notepad Info will not intentionally distribute any of your personal information stored on this website; your e-mail address will never be given to third parties. Your password has been stored only as a salted hash, placing the bottleneck of your password security in your hands.
</p>

<p>
Your stored notepad data itself never be distributed to third parties not actively bearing a valid U.S. subpeona. However, your notepad data is not encrypted when stored in the database (this is necessary to facilitate features like e-mail recovery) and neither is it encrypted en route from your computer to our server. This is probably not of interest to most people, but I would not advise you to use this service to store very sensitive information. A general rule of thumb is that you probably shouldn't put anything here you wouldn't put on a sticky note.
